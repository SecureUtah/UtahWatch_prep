<h1>Welcome to UtahWatch</h1>

<h2>About</h2>
<p>UtahWatch tracks the HTTPS support of websites of Utah-based businesses and organizations.  It does not track the websites of entities that have a presence in Utah but are headquartered elsewhere.

<p>It is not practical to track every website in Utah. Although the goal is to have all websites move to HTTPS some editorial decisions must be made. The hope is that if the sites listed here have high quality HTTPS implementations then the others will follow.

<p>UtahWatch is a project by <a href="https://secureutah.org">SecureUtah.org</a> and is a fork of <a href="https://httpswatch.com">HTTPSWatch.com</a>. 	This is a work in progress.  Please send all suggestions, revisions, and feedback to: choose+tracking@secureutah.org


<h2>Ratings</h2>
<p>UtahWatch assigns every tracked site a rating approximating the quality of its HTTPS support. If a verified TLS connection cannot be established or no page can be loaded over TLS, the site is given the <span class="site-grade-bad">Bad</span> rating. The <span class="site-grade-mediocre">Mediocre</span> rating means a TLS connection can be established but there are quality issues with the site&rsquo;s implementation of HTTPS (e.g. the HTTP site doesn&rsquo;t redirect to HTTPS or the <code>Strict-Transport-Security</code> header isn&rsquo;t set). If everything looks good, a <span class="site-grade-good">Good</span> rating is given.


<h2>Limitations</h2>
<p>Some sites which UtahWatch rates as <span class="site-grade-mediocre">Mediocre</span> are actually unusable in a browser. This is mostly due to <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Security/MixedContent">mixed content</a>, which UtahWatch doesn&rsquo;t always detect.
<p>Aside from the basic hostname verification checks, UtahWatch doesn&rsquo;t attempt to evaluate the quality of the TLS connection. However, the grade the <a href="https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/">SSL Labs server TLS testing tool</a> assigns is provided for each site.


<h2>How to Properly Setup HTTPS</h2>
<p>Please see this list of <a href="https://secureutah.org/https/resources">Resources</a> for assistance with deploying and configuring HTTPS.


<h2>Code</h2>
