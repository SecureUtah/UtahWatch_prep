<center><h2>About</h2></center>
<p><strong>UtahWatch</strong> evaluates and rates the <strong>HTTPS support</strong> of the websites of almost 300 Utah-based businesses, organizations, groups, and people. No other security assessments of the websites are performed - the ratings do <strong>not</strong> indicate if a website is insecure, untrustworthy, or unsafe. Please contact the website owner directly with any questions about their security practices.

<p>It is not practical to include every website in Utah. Although the ultimate goal is to have all websites move to HTTPS some editorial decisions must be made. The hope is that if the prominent sites listed here have high quality HTTPS then the others will follow. Entities that have a presence in Utah but are headquartered elsewhere are not tracked.

<p>Ratings will be produced at least once a month. Websites could be added or removed at any time.

<p>UtahWatch is part of <a href="http://secureutah.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>SecureUtah.org</strong></a>. Please visit SecureUtah.org to learn why HTTPS is crucial to a safe Internet, why it should be supported by every website, and why Utah should take the lead in promoting and supporting it.

<center><h2>Ratings</h2></center>
<p>UtahWatch uses a simple rating scale to make it easy to see if basic HTTPS has been achieved and to inspire change if it has not. Strong HTTPS has many moving parts that can be best evaluated using the <a href="https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Qualys SSL Labs</a> and <a href="https://securityheaders.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SecurityHeaders.io</a> services.

<p>A <span class="site-grade-bad"><strong>Bad</strong></span> rating is given if:
<ul type="square" >
<li>HTTPS redirects to HTTP</li>
<li>the domain name does not match the TLS certificate hostname</li>
<li>the TLS connection times out</li>
<li>no page can be loaded over TLS</li>
<li>there are mixed content errors</li>
<li>the website uses a self-signed certificate</li>
</ul>

<p>A <span class="site-grade-mediocre"><strong>Mediocre</strong></span> rating means a TLS connection can be established but there are quality issues with the site&rsquo;s implementation, such as the HTTP site doesn&rsquo;t redirect to HTTPS and/or the <strong>Strict-Transport-Security</strong> header isn&rsquo;t set.

<p>A <span class="site-grade-good"><strong>Good</strong></span> rating is given if all of the above conditions are met. However, <span class="site-grade-good"><strong>Good</strong></span> does not necessarily mean that a website's configuration work is complete (e.g. UtahWatch does not evaluate any subdomains besides WWW), nor does it mean that a website is free from other security risks or vulnerabilities.
<br>
<br>
<center><h2>Missing HSTS = Mediocre</h2></center>
<p>Many of the sites that receive a <span class="site-grade-mediocre"><strong>Mediocre</strong></span> rating are only missing the <strong>HTTP Strict-Transport-Security</strong> (HSTS) header. The HSTS header has become a vital component of helping visitors reach a website securely.  Implementing HTTPS is not something that should be done piecemeal - without HSTS it is still possible for an attacker to intercept web traffic and prevent users from connecting over HTTPS. Thus, websites will not be rated <span class="site-grade-good"><strong>Good</strong></span> unless they include HSTS.

<p>Please read more about the importance of using HTTP Strict Transport Security:

<li>Troy Hunt <a href="http://www.troyhunt.com/2015/06/understanding-http-strict-transport.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">illustrated</a> how HTTPS can be stripped from websites that are missing HSTS.</li>

<li>Including <a href="https://https.cio.gov/hsts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HSTS</a> is part of the White House OMB's <a href="https://https.cio.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">requirements</a> for federal websites.</li>
<li>Mozilla's guide for web developers <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/HTTP_strict_transport_security" target="_blank" rel="noopener">provides further details</a> for implementing HSTS.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<center><h2>Limitations</h2></center>
<p>Some sites which UtahWatch rates as <span class="site-grade-mediocre"><strong>Mediocre</strong></span> might actually be unusable in a browser. This is mostly due to <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Security/MixedContent" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mixed content</a>, which UtahWatch doesn&rsquo;t always detect.
<p>Although self-signed certificates are not inherently untrustworthy, UtahWatch gives a <span class="site-grade-bad"><strong>Bad</strong></span> rating to websites that use them because modern browsers will display a prominent warning to users when they try to visit those sites.
<p>Aside from the basic hostname verification checks, UtahWatch doesn&rsquo;t attempt to evaluate the quality of the TLS connection. Please use the provided <a href="https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SSL Labs server TLS testing tool</a> link for each website to view an in-depth assessment.  Please use <a href="https://securityheaders.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SecurityHeaders.io</a> to evaluate a site's HTTP response headers.

<center><h2>Credits</h2></center>
<p>UtahWatch was created and is maintained by Jon Jarvis.

<p>UtahWatch is a fork of <a href="https://httpswatch.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HTTPSWatch.com</a>. The HTTPSWatch project code is available on <a href="https://github.com/gutworth/httpswatch" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub</a> and was originally created by Benjamin Peterson.  Many thanks to Benjamin for giving approval to fork his code and for providing early assistance to get UtahWatch going!

<p>HTTPSWatch was inspired by Alex Gaynor&rsquo;s <a href="https://alexgaynor.net/2014/nov/12/state-of-news-tls/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blog</a> <a href="https://alexgaynor.net/2014/dec/30/state-of-news-tls-part-ii/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posts</a> about news sites&rsquo; HTTPS support.

<p>Much respect to <a href="https://www.qualys.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Qualys</a> and <a href="http://blog.ivanristic.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ivan RistiÄ‡</a> for creating the excellent <a href="https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SSL Server Test</a> that has become the de facto standard for testing and grading HTTPS.

<p>Much respect to <a href="https://scotthelme.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Scott Helme</a> for making <a href="https://securityheaders.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SecurityHeaders.io</a>, a very useful and necessary tool that I wish I knew how to build.
